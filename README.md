Repository for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data project.

Contains the components of tidy data and the script for the data cleaning and analysis:

1. UCI HAR Dataset - The raw data
2. cow.txt - The tidy data set
3. codebook.md - A code book describing variables and its values
4. run_analysis.R - The script: recipe I used to go from 1 -> 2, 3
